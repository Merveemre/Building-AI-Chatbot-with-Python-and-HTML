# Building-AI-Chatbot-with-Python-and-HTML
This project is in progress and aims to create a simple AI-powered chatbot using Python, Flask framewrok and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. The chatbot allows users to interact with the AI through a web interface built with HTML and Flask.

Features
- User-friendly interface with HTML for chatting with the bot
- Real-time AI responses powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5
- Built using Flask framework in Python
- Simple and lightweight structure for easy deployment
- Access the chatbot via http://127.0.0.1:5000/ during running the app locally.

OpenAI API Key : you'll need to obtain an API key. Once you have the key, it is suggested to be secured by setting it as an environment variable in your terminal. To do it;

1. Obtain your OpenAI API Key from https://platform.openai.com/
   
2. Set the API key in your terminal:
   On Windows (PowerShell):
     ```bash
     $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
  

You can find a screenshot of the chatbot interface in the files to see how it looks when the application is working.

Current Status : 
This project is currently in progress. It will be fully functional and ready for public deployment soon.
